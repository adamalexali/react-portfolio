            &nbsp;I'm a Toronto-based digital experience designer. I have a keen
            interest in creating meaningful user experiences for the web,

          <p>
            Within the past few years, I've had the opportunity to work on the
            conceptualization, research, design, and development of a number of
            digital projects, during which I've drawn from and honed my skills
            in various disciplines ‚Äî including graphic design, web development,
            motion graphics, 3D modeling, immersive XR, &amp; data
            visualization.

            I am constantly learning, as I find having a foundation in a diverse
            set of fields allows me to apply knowledge and understand problems
            in unique ways. I use what I've learned to explore the relationships
            between people &amp; technology and in doing so, design better
            products/systems/services.

              My most recent major school project involved creating an immersive
              augmented reality experience that utilized open source data. A
              solo project; my tasks included research &amp; ideation, design of
              interactive prototypes and user flows, collecting &amp; modeling
              assets, and designing &amp; developing the AR experience for iOS.

              Myself along with other students of the Interatction Design
              program participated in the annual year-end show for the School of
              Design. We aimed to answer the question, ‚ÄúWhat does it mean to
              live autonomously?‚Äù. Our solution was a virtual reality immersive
              experience that demonstrates a concept for a modular home. My role
              involved defining the user experience, designing the interface,
              presenting the design solutions to stakeholders, and facilitating
              the experience for visitors.
