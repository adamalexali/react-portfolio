            &nbsp;I'm a Toronto-based digital experience designer. I have a keen
            interest in creating meaningful user experiences for the web,
            mobile, &amp; beyond!
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the past few years, I've had the opportunity to work on the
            conceptualization, research, design, and development of a number of
            digital projects, during which I've drawn from and honed my skills
            in various disciplines ‚Äî including graphic design, web development,
            motion graphics, 3D modeling, immersive XR, &amp; data
            visualization.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am constantly learning, as I find having a foundation in a diverse
            set of fields allows me to apply knowledge and understand problems
            in unique ways. I use what I've learned to explore the relationships
            between people &amp; technology and in doing so, design better
            products/systems/services.
